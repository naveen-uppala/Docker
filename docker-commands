1) docker –version  --> This command is used to get the currently installed version of docker

2) docker pull  --> This command is used to pull images from the docker repository(hub.docker.com)
   Usage: docker pull <image name>

3) docker run  -->  This command is used to create a container from an image
   Usage: docker run -d --name <container-name> -p <HostPort:containerport> imagename:tag 

4) docker ps  -->  This command is used to list the running containers

5) docker ps -a  -->  This command is used to show all the running and exited containers

6) docker exec  -->  This command is used to access the running container
   Usage: docker exec -it <container-id> bash

7) docker stop  -->  This command stops a running container
   Usage: docker stop <container-id>

8) docker kill  -->  This command kills the container by stopping its execution immediately. 
   The difference between ‘docker kill’ and ‘docker stop’ is that ‘docker stop’ gives the container time to shutdown gracefully,
   in situations when it is taking too much time for getting the container to stop, one can opt to kill it 
   Usage: docker kill <container id>

9) docker commit  -->  This command creates a new image of an edited container on the local system
   Usage: docker commit <conatainer id> <username/imagename>

10) docker login  -->  This command is used to login to the docker hub repository

12) docker images  -->  This command lists all the locally stored docker images

13) docker rm  -->  This command is used to delete a stopped container
    Usage: docker rm <container-id>

14) docker rmi  -->  This command is used to delete an image from local storage

    Usage: docker logs <container-id>
    
17) docker logout  -->  This command is used to logout from docker hub repository

18) docker run --mount source=[volume_name],destination=[path_in_container] [docker_image]  --> Mount a volume to a docker container

19) docker volume inspect [volume_name]  -->  To display detailed information about a specific Docker volume in JSON format.

20) docker volume list  --> Lists all Docker volumes currently on your system

21) docker volume create [volume_name]  --> creates a new named Docker volume that can be used to store persistent data for containers

22) docker system prune -af --> Can delete data you might want to keep (like unused images or volumes)
